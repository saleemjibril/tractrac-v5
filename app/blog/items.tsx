          Hook,
          <br /> Daily records show there is a high level of hunger in the
          country. Eating just one unbalanced meal a day is the norm for many
          families. The most reliant field, agriculture yields no significant
          impact. FAO points that agricultural mechanisation involves three
          different levels: human powered sources, animal power based
          mechanisation and engine powered machines. While many countries are at
          the machinery and technological stage, African countries are still at
          the first stage: “human powered sources”. This stage is characterized
          by the replacement of animate power with mechanical power from
          internal combustion engines or electric motors to perform
          energy-intensive tasks, such as primary land tillage and grain milling
          (FAO;2018).

          According to Tractor Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria
          (TOOAN) more than 70% of farm labour is provided by human power, over
          20 percent is provided with draft animal power and less than 10
          percent by mechanical power in Nigeria (Business Day; 2020).
          Furthermore, the International Conference of the West African Society
          of Agricultural Engineering states that, 90% of farmers in Nigeria
          conduct farm operations using hand tool technologies and traditional
          agricultural methods. This is the case because many farmers lack the
          resources to acquire agricultural machinery like tractors.

            WHY AGRICULTURAL MECHANISATION IS IMPORTANT
          </Box>
          -It increases the food production capacity of farmers per land area.
          For example, D. R. Bomford explained that, “The ploughman with his
          three-horse am controlled three- horse; power, when given a
          medium-sized crawler tractor controlled between 20 to 30 horse powers.
          His output, therefore, went up in the ratio of about 8: 1.” Therefore
          it facilitates timeliness in production leading to higher income for
          farmers.
          <br />
          -With an effective mechanized agricultural system, the foreign
          exchange earning potential would improve. Progression from subsistence
          to commercial farming increases the chances of exporting food products
          to other countries.
          <br />
          -It increases the participation of youths and the educated in farming
          activities. Many youths derail from agriculture as a result of the
          efforts and energy if demands.
          <br />
          -It serves as an advancement opportunity for farming ventures and
          mechanical cooperation as it improves profitability, value of products
          and encourages industrialisation.

            HOW TRACTRAC IS IMPACTING AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES
          </Box>
          Tractrac (add link) is working towards changing the narrative by
          improving agricultural mechanisation in Nigeria with the aim of
          promoting sustainability in food production. It is providing tractors
          to small holder farmers across the country who lack access to farming
          mechanisms. It leverages ICT and crowdfunding methodology to improve
          access to tractor procurement, create access to mechanisation services
          for smallholder farmers and enhance efficient utilization of tractors.
          <br />
          Conclusively, mechanization level directly affects growth and socio-
          economic development. The cost of production can be adjusted properly
          if mechanization is resorted. It will also ensure that income is
          multiplied and the farmer&#39;s economic condition is improved.

          was introduced shortly after Nigeria had her independence. Since then,
          the public sector has been on the pursuit to increase the number of
          tractors available. The inability for the government to meet up with
          the demands for mechanisation discourages farmer&#39;s from accessing
          better agricultural engagements, which has caused the agricultural
          sector to grow slowly.
        </Text>
        <Text mt="20px">
          With Mechanisation farmers can get a large portion of their farm work
          done within a short period of time thereby increasing the possibility
          of large food production. For instance farmers with functional
          tractors can plough a large piece of land in hours, while farmers that
          rely on animal farm power will take days to complete. A tractor will
          do in a day what animal farm power will take weeks to complete.

        <Text mt="20px">
          The socio-economic implications of mechanization to farmers cannot be
          overemphasised. Farmers with machinery and adequate capacities are
          more likely to transect from subsistence to commercial farming thereby
          increasing the income of farmers and a better living standard for
          their family.

        <Text mt="20px">
          Mechanisation aids in all farming activities; from cultivation to post
          harvesting activities. Through mechanisation farmers have an improved
          means of storage thereby preserving commodity value. Also
          mechanisation has the tendency of maintaining soil fertility and land
          productivity, hence an environmental effect.

          Tractrac is filling in the void of inadequate mechanisation to small
          holder farmers. These farmers lack the financial resources to access

          Food Production involves a wide range of complex procedures such as
          land clearing, planting and weeding, harvesting, transportation,
          processing, storage and consumption. This process requires
          mechanization and technological inventions to improve and facilitate
          production as well as increase productivity. According to a study
          published by the International Conference of the West African Society
          of Agricultural Engineering, 90% of farmers in Nigeria conduct farm
          operations using hand tool technologies and traditional agricultural
          methods. This is the case because many farmers lack the resources to
          acquire agricultural machinery like tractors and ploughs. This article
          explains why agricultural mechanization is essential.

            WHAT IS AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION?
          </Box>
          According to the FAO, it is the process of improving farm labour
          productivity through the use of agricultural machinery, implements,
          and tools. It also involves the provision and use of all forms of
          power sources and mechanical assistance to agriculture, from simple
          hand tools to animal draught power (DAP), and mechanical power
          technologies. Agricultural mechanization is often associated solely
          with tractors and sophisticated agricultural machinery. <br />
          According to FAO (Clarke, 1997), the term “Agricultural mechanization”
          generally refers to the application of tools, implements, and powered
          machinery as inputs to achieve agricultural production.
          <br /> A sustainable agricultural mechanization strategy is a planning
          strategy that contributes to the goal of sustainable agriculture, and
          at the same time accepts food self-sufficiency and generates economic
          and inclusive growth as well as social benefits. Over the years the
          Nigerian agricultural sector has been lagging behind in terms of
          agricultural mechanization. Food production increases have not kept
          pace with population growth, resulting in rising food imports and
          declining levels of national food self-sufficiency (FMARD, 2008). It
          is estimated that Nigeria has lost USD 10 billion in annual export
          opportunity.
        </Text>
        <Text mt="20px">
          Furthermore, there are less than 5,000 tractors in Nigeria hence
          making it onerous to access tractors by smallholder farmers in
          Nigeria. These issues have made it tough to access mechanization
          services in Nigeria hence affecting productivity, livelihood and in
          turn Food security. <br />
          Financing tractors for smallholder farmers has been a daunting
          challenge. From the rise in exchange rate to the hurdles of meeting
          banks&apos; requirements, small holder farmers across Nigeria and
          Africa at large are unable to own tractors. Owning one is out of their
          league, yet they constitute 70% of farmers in Sub Saharan Africa.
          <br />
          Another key issue limiting market growth is tractor under-utilisation,
          attributable to disconnects in the market - between tractor owners
          with idle assets and service providers able to maximise the
          productivity of those assets, and between supply and demand for
          tractor services across the country. There are pockets of tractors
          spread across the country predominantly owned by governments which are
          left fallow in yards, and others owned by individuals who are left
          with excess capacity after use of their tractors for their individual
          farmlands. The disconnect between demand and supply is attributable to
          location and communication challenges with service providers in one
          location being unable to effectively connect to demand in other
          locations given the current system for connecting to demand which
          relies on extensive on-ground infrastructural capabilities and
          investments in a wide-reaching agency network

            WHY AGRICULTURAL MECHANISATION IS IMPORTANT

          The utilization of Agricultural mechanization can engender the growth

              It has the ability to Increase the food production capacity of
              farmers leading to reduced poverty and improved livelihoods. The
              process of agricultural production poses not to be extraneous
              alone but very slow. This can affect the level of production and
              profit leading to little returns. Agricultural mechanization could
              hasten the process. For example, D. R. Bomford explained that,
              “The ploughman with his three-horse am controlled three- horse;
              power, when given a medium-sized crawler tractor controlled
              between 20 to 30 horse power. His output, there-fore, went up in
              the ratio of about 8: 1.”

              With an effective mechanized agricultural system, the foreign
              exchange earning potential would improve. Progression from
              subsistence to commercial farming promotes the exportation of food
              products to other countries.

            <ListItem>
              Agricultural mechanization increases the participation of the
              youth and the educated in farming activities. This is because it
              reduces the stress and drudgery involved in farming many youths
              derail from agriculture as a result of the strenuous efforts and
              energy it demands. Also, it improves the profitability of farming
              ventures which increases the interest of the masses.
            </ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          It is found that the cost of production can be adjusted properly if
          mechanization is resorted. It will also ensure that income is
          multiplied and the farmers economic condition is improved. Therefore,
          there is a need for the government and private organisations to devise
          strategies that can spur agricultural development. Collaboration with
          private institutions is encouraged as well for the utilisation of
          expertise and other useful resources.
          <br />
          To this end, Tractrac created a platform that allows all value chain
          actors in mechanization to participate in improving access to
          affordable Mechanization services for smallholder farmers across
          Nigeria. See how TracTrac is using its digital platform to reach two
          million farmers across Nigeria. The end goal is to enhance food
          security, productivity and livelihood of these farmers.
